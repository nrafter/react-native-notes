# react-native-notes
Clone of https://github.com/shoumma/Asprov-Notes with react-navigation and redux

I upgraded Asprov-Notes with react-navigation, a login system, changed all the components to stateless
that did not keep any kind of state, hooked up redux and persistance and organized code to do async requests
to remote APIs with redux-thunk
